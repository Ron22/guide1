For more information on hiding and displaying modules, please refer to the Layout Options section of the [Administration documentation](http://primod.github.io/documentation/doc/).

For more information on displaying and hiding modules throughout MaaxFrame, please refer to the Developer Tools documentation in the Administration guide.

#### Leads Quick View

- Creating Leads

  - There are various methods for creating leads in MaaxFrame including via the Leads module, duplication, web-to-lead form. The same record view layout opens when creating the lead directly from the Leads menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's leads. Please note that administrators can configure the Record View layout. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the documentation in the [Administration guide](http://primod.github.io/documentation/doc/).
 
 ***Creating Via Web-to-Lead Form*** : MaaxFrame provides a simple way to allow visitors to your website or other online location to become leads in your MaaxFrame instance. You can create a web-to-lead form in MaaxFrame and place the form on an external website. Then when a visitor to your site completes and submits the form, their information is entered into MaaxFrame as a new lead record. For more information on creating and managing web-to-lead forms, please refer to the Web-To-Lead Forms documentation.

- Viewing Leads

  - There are various options available for viewing lead records in MaaxFrame including via Leads list view, Leads record view, dashlets, and reports.

- Searching Leads

  - The Leads list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Leads list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire MaaxFrame database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that MaaxFrame automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word “smith” in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.

  For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the Search documentation.

- Leads List View

  - The Leads list view displays all lead records meeting the current search criteria to which your user has access. You can view the basic details of each lead within the field columns. Please note that you will only be able to see lead records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the Team Management and Role Management documentation in the Administration guide.

- Leads Record View

 - The Leads record view displays thorough lead information including all lead fields. Beneath the fields you can toggle between viewing a lead's subpanels of related records (Campaigns) and the lead's activity stream. The record view can be reached by clciking a lead record's link from anywhere in the application including from the Leads list view.

 Please note that you will only be able to view a lead record according to your team membership, user type, and role restrictions. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the Team Management and Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the Studio documentation in the Administration guide.

- Deleting Records

 - If a lead record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's MaaxFrame instance, it may be deleted from either the Leads record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting lead records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.

 Please note that your ability to delete leads in MaaxFrame may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Delete options.


- Converting Leads

 - MaaxFrame enables you to convert leads into contacts as you determine they qualify for your organization's definition of a contact (e.g. after an evaluation/qualification process or upon entering into business with the individual). When the lead is converted, a new contact record is created in MaaxFrame with a relationship to the original lead record. The Convert Lead page also gives you the option to create an account and opportunity record.

  ![](img/Leads5.PNG) 

- Exporting Leads

  - MaaxFrame's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected leads to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Lead data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting.  Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of lead records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.

 Leads may be exported from the Leads list view by selecting "Export Selected" from the More menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for leads and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in MaaxFrame, please refer to the Export documentation.

 ![](img/Leads6.PNG)

 Please note that your ability to export leads from MaaxFrame may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Export option.

- Viewing Lead Change Logs
 
 - Changes made to each lead record are tracked over time, and users are able to view the history of changes via the change log in each lead's record view. To view the change log, navigate to a lead in record view and select "Logs" inside the Actions menu. For more information on designating for audit, please refer to the documentation in the Administration guide.

 ## Opportunities

---

#### Overview

MaaxFrame's Opportunities module allows you to track individual sales from start to finish. Each opportunity record represents a prospective sale and includes relevant sale data as well as relating to other important records such as quotes, contacts, etc. An opportunity will typically progress through several Sales Stages until it is marked either "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". Opportunities can be leveraged even further by using MaaxFrame's Forecasting to understand and predict sales trends as well as focus work to achieve sales quotas.

#### Opportunities Fields

The Opportunities module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with MaaxFrame. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Settings.

### Sales Stages

A sales stage identifies the current stage (e.g. Prospecting, Qualification, etc.) that the opportunity is in during the sales cycle. When you select a sales stage in the opportunity record, the system automatically populates the corresponding probability value (e.g. 10, 20, etc.) in the Probability (%) field. These probability values are a useful tool as it helps calculate and predict your sales forecast for a specified time period. For more information on configuring the sales stages and probability values, please refer to the Developer Tools documentation in the  [Administration guide](http://primod.github.io/documentation/doc/).

Please note that the below values are only guidelines for defining your sales stage and you can skip one or more stages based on your organization's needs.
